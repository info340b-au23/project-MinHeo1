    <h1>Problem Description</h1>
    <section>
        American football is <strong>THE</strong> most popular sport in the United States. With a viewership of <cite><a 
            href="https://statisticsanddata.org/data/most-popular-sports-in-the-united-states/">74.5%</a></cite> American Football is undoubtedly the the average Americans
            favorite pasttime. With this strong viewership, comes the need for friendly competition among it's viewers. One of the most popular, and fun, types of this is 
            fantasy football. The gist of fantasy football is viewers join a league (with friends or strangers) where they pick players from the NFL and compete against other
            viewers in that league. The way to win is based off of points. The better a player does the more points they score for the viewer. With the growing popularity of fantasy
            football, ESPN reports a <cite><a href="https://espnpressroom.com/us/press-releases/2022/09/espn-fantasy-football-11-million-players-sets-new-all-time-record/">new record high of players</a></cite>
            there is a need to figure out who the best players are. The biggest problem present at the moment, is the unpredictabilty of fantasy. Players within fantasy don't want to
            calculate or figure out who might score the best points or who might be a sleeper pick. Instead, they rely either on personal bias (such as their favorite players) or
            by word of mouth. Our project attempts to solve this problem. We would like to create an interactive website that allows fantasy players to filter and pick players based off
            of a variety of factors such as position, predicted points, and others. A current app that attempts to do this is ESPN Fantasy. This app is the perennial app for all things fantasy.
            Although they do a good job at providing some information (such as position, players, matchups, etc.) it is insufficient when it comes to predicted points and who the use should
            pick. As seen by their <cite><a href="https://www.espn.com/fantasy/football/">website</a></cite> there isn't a specific feature that allows you to sort players to see who is "good" and "bad". 
            In addition to this, there are issues such as a lot of information being stuck behind <cite><a href="https://www.espn.com/fantasy/football/insider/story/_/page/consistency2123/fantasy-football-consistency-ratings-2021-2023">paywalls</a></cite>. 
            Thus, we believe our project sufficiently covers this hole in the game of fantasy. Being able to help viewers pick and make the "right" decision in an evergrouwing game is what
            our project attempts to do.
